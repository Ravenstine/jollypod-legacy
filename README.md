## JollyPod

I have uploaded this code for posterity's sake.  Currently, JollyPod is down and I am re-writing the back-end to use EventMachine instead of Rails.  You can still see how I was transcoding/streaming mp3 chunks in the [streams controller](https://github.com/Ravenstine/jollypod-legacy/blob/master/app/controllers/streams_controller.rb).

For shortcodes to work, you need to have redis-server installed.
