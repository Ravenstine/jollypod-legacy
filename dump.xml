How does our knowledge grow? It turns out there are some different ideas about that. Schemas, Four-Stage Theory of Cognitive Development, and Vygotsky&#39;s Theory of Scaffolding all play different roles but the basic idea is that children think about things very differently than adults. Hank explains in today&#39;s episode of Crash Course Psychology.

Herman Rorschach (no, not the guy from Watchmen) came up with the eponymous tests, but what do they mean? Why are we so fascinated with them despite the division in the world of Psychology? Hank tackles these topics as we take a closer look at personality in this episode of Crash Course Psychology.

How would you measure a personality? What, exactly, is the self? Well, as you&#39;ve come to expect, it&#39;s not that easy to nail down an answer for those questions. Whether you&#39;re into blood, bile, earth, wind, fire, or those Buzzfeed questionnaires, there are LOTS of ways to get at who we are and why.

So, how many different kinds of intelligence are there? And what is the G-Factor? Eugenics? Have you ever taken an IQ Test? All of these things play into the fascinating and sometimes icky history of Intelligence Testing. In this episode of Crash Course Psychology, Hank talks us through some of the important aspects of that history... as well as Nazis. Hey, I said some of it was icky.

Even if you&#39;re Mel Gibson or Kanye, it&#39;s probably best to not wear all of your emotions on your sleeve. In this episode of Crash Course Psychology, Hank talks about these things called &quot;Emotions&quot;. What are they? And why do we need them?
